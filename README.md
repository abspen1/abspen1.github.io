My Webapp

## Games
* So far just [Hangman](https://github.com/abspen1/hangman-js)
* Most likely will add Rock Paper Scissors 
* Could also add a buffer screen where you choose out of the possible games
* Link back to home page
* Could also switch this to a projects tab and take to a page full of projects
    * If there isn't a browser version of the project just link to the url in github
* Could add link to source project within each browser version as well

## 404 Page
* Added a wild 404 page with some crazy colors
* There is a link back to home page

## Social Links
* Open in new tab since there isn't a link back to home page
* Removed Facebook since I don't really use Facebook
