My Webapp

## Games
* Could add link to source project within each browser version as well
### Hangman
* Added random-words generator with browserify 😍

## 404 Page
* Added a wild 404 page with some crazy colors
* There is a link back to home page

## Social Links
* Open in new tab since there isn't a link back to home page
* Removed Facebook since I don't really use Facebook
* Move these to their own page

## New Projects
* Cool idea but tough to implement
* Rattled my brain on how to persist the data but so far no luck
* Currently using browserify and fs

## To-Do
### Add a page for project ideas!!
* Add README to individual folders that we link to

## Sources
### Animated Background
