My Webapp

## About
* Added info form that can email me when someone wants to send me something!
* Was able to do this with my [backend](https://github.com/abspen1/go-backend) to persist data running Go

### Hangman
* Added random-words generator with browserify 😍

## 404 Page
* Added a wild 404 page with some crazy colors
* There is a link back to home page

## Social Links
* Open in new tab since there isn't a link back to home page
* Removed Facebook since I don't really use Facebook
* Move these to their own page

## Next Project
* Uses my [backend](https://github.com/abspen1/go-backend) to persist data
* Might need to adjust the format of the description string..
* Backend is running on guldentech.com
* Still need to code the remove function on the backend

## To-Do
### Add a page for project ideas!!
* Add README to individual folders that we link to
