# abspen1.github.io
My Webapp

## Games
* Could add link to source project within each browser version as well
### Hangman
* Added random-words generator with browserify 😍

## 404 Page
* Added a wild 404 page with some crazy colors
* There is a link back to home page

## Social Links
* Open in new tab since there isn't a link back to home page
* Removed Facebook since I don't really use Facebook
* Move these to their own page

## New Projects
* Officially working while running locally
* Uses my [backend](https://github.com/abspen1/go-backend) to persist data
* Might need to adjust the format of the description string..
* Looking into hosting the backend on an AWS cloud server to run 24/7
* I then should be able to actually merge this to master with working next project page

## To-Do
### Add a page for project ideas!!
* Add README to individual folders that we link to

## Sources
